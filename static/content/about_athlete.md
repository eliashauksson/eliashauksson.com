Outside of engineering, I spend most of my free time in the mountains. I'm drawn to endurance sports - especially trail running and mountaineering - where focus and persistence matter as much as strength.

I've completed several ultra trail races, including the Eiger Ultra Trail E51 (51km, 3000m D+) and the Laugavegur Ultra Marathon in Iceland (55k, 1800m D+). These experiences taught me how to manage effort, discomfort, and the long-term mindset needed to reach the finish line. Looking ahead, I plan to take on longer challenges such as the Eiger Ultra E101, and one day, maybe even the infamous UTMB 100 miler.

Beyond running, I love mountaineering and rock climbing, spending time on alpine routes and learning to move more confidently on technical terrain. My goal is to eventually take on some of the classic ascents of the Alps - peaks like the Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau, or Mont Blanc.

In the past years, I've also grown to enjoy cycling, both for training and travel. I took part in my first road race, the Tour de Léman (180km), and I'm now preparing for a bikepacking journey from Portugal to Nordkapp, Norway - a multi-month trip I plan to begin after completing my military service.
