My journey into engineering started early. At around twelve, I began coding my own games in Python and Pygame - simple projects that sparked a fascination for ideas could turn into something real and interactive.

When I began my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at EPFL, that curiosity naturally expanded into hardware. I discovered a passion for designing and building systems that bridge software and electronics. Alongside my coursework, I joined the EPFL Rocket Team, where I worked on PCB design and embedded programming for various subsystems.

For my bachelor thesis, I joined EPFLoop, the Hyperloop team of EPFL, contributing to the next-generation motherboard of the pod. I focused on renewing and improving PCBs, enhancing functionality for sensor routing and high-voltage, high-current distribution.

Beyond university, I spent a summer at Hauksson Weine, developing a TensorFlow-based AI model to help a rover navigate autonomously through a vineyard. Later, I worked for a year at SkyWatch A/S, as part of the hardware team, where I developed hardware testing tools and wrote a Python library for motor controller communication.

Through these experiences, I've grown passionate about creating systems that connect the digital and physical worlds - where reliablity, clarity, and thoughtful design matter most.
