# Skitouring Weekend in the Jungfrau Region

I had the chance to go on this beautiful ski-trip in the Jungfrau region organized by the SAC Lauterbrunnen. While in mid-April it was already getting warm at home, the conditions were perfect in the high alpine Jungfrau region to go ski-touring. The adventure started already on Thursday evening, when I was trying to fit all the necessary gear and food for a 3 day trip in my 26 liter ski-touring backpack, which wasn't an easy task. But after an hour of compressing everything to its minimal volume and some high level Tetris skills, everything was in place. The next morning we took an early train ride to the Jungfraujoch (3463m) and unusual to other ski-tours, we could first enjoy the descent down to the Konkordiaplatz.

There we started our first ascent for the day up to the Grünhornlücke. Even though we were at 2850m it was already quite warm in the sun.

As we reached the Grünhornlücke (3270m) we were all sweating from the ascent and the heat of the sun. We there then decided to go down directly to the Finsteraarhornhütte, where we would sleep, because of the heat and the snow conditions. At the hut we spent the rest of the afternoon chilling and enjoying the views. This evening we then decided that the next day we would summit the grosses Wannenhorn (3906m). This would be my first time spending the night at that height and I already noticed during the afternoon the I had a higher resting heart rate than usual, it being 20 bpm higher. But apart from that I didn't feel any other differences.

The next morning we woke up nice and early at 05:30am and after breakfast we were already on our skis at 6am. From the hut we first skied down the Fieschergletscher for a bit until we started to ascent. Already from the bottom we saw a lot of nice descent tracks and I was already looking forward to it. Also we could already see the summit and the cool view of the glacier that covered it.

The higher up we got the more I started to notice the thin air and how I had to breath a bit more heavily because of it. This was an interesting experience, since I never had skied in these heights before. As we reached the summit after a couple of hours, we were greeted with an amazing view of most of the swiss alps.

We could see most of the famous peaks like the Matterhorn or Mont Blanc. And just on the other side we had a great view of the Finsteraarhorn, the biggest mountain in the bernese alps, just on the other side of the glacier.

After a quick photo-session and snack we started with our descent. Because of the heat the previous days, we weren't expecting much powder, but our mountain-guide Dänel, lead us down a path, with no other tracks and surprisingly we found some really good powder to enjoy.

This must have been the best powder snow I've ever had in April. After the fabulous descent. We walked back up to the hut and were already back by lunchtime. The rest of the afternoon again were spent by chilling and enjoying the scenery.

The next day we started even earlier at 04:30am. And the first part we descended the glacier in complete darkness, only having our headlamps as guidance. We then reached the Galmigletscher, where we started our ascent.

After a while it started to get bright and the peaks around us were painted in orange.

A bit later we then reached the summit of the Galmihorn (3507m), out last peak of this trip. We now had our biggest descent before us down to the valley. We crossed the Bächlilicke and then went down the Bächligletscher. The valley below us was already green, so we skied as far as we could, crossing small rivers and remainders of avalanches. Some proper Spring Skiing.

The very last part we then had to walk down to Reckingen. In the valley it felt like a different world: No snow and 25 degrees Celcius. We took the train to Brig, where the rest of the group went back to Stechelberg/Wengen and I took the train back to Lausanne. All in all this was a very fun ski-weekend (and probably the last one this season).
