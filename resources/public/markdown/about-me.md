# About me

Hi, I'm El√≠as. I'm a 21-year-old electrical engineering student at EPFL with a passion for robotics. When I'm not tinkering with robots or diving into engineering projects, you can find me in the mountains. I'm an avid trail runner, mountaineer, and climber seeking new challenges and conquering peaks. Join me on this journey as I share my experiences, insights, and creations in the world of engineering and outdoor adventures.
